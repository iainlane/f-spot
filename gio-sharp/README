Gio# is an unstable .NET language binding for libgio distributed as part
of the glib package.  Gio# is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL.  
The target is the 2.16 initial release of gio.

It is anticipated that these bindings will be integrated into the gtk-sharp
package during the 2.14 release cycle, and this independent package will
cease to exist.  This product is just provided for the impatient soles who
feel they must chase the bleeding edge and help us find bugs before we
integrate the library.

Building & Installing Gio#:
---------------------------

    The build is the traditional:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    If you are compiling from SVN, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
    and will need to replace the configure above with autogen.sh.
