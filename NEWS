The highlights of 0.0.5 include:
- Much faster image loading and switching.
- Much faster orientation loading.  The rotation and flipping code has
  been optimized and tested .
- Faster Scrolling in Icon move.  Less computation per image means
  smoother scrolling.
- Basic CD export capability with nautilus-cd-burner.
- Basic gnome-vfs export.  There are still some problems with
  destinations that require auth, but the building blocks are there.
- New UI. Menus, toolbar and color scheme have been updated.
- Improved color adjustment ui.  The adjusted colors are now previewed
  in the main ui.
- Improved thumnbnail generation.
- We now check for duplicate images on import.
- Move back to gtk-sharp 1.0.  Using 1.9 was too big of a step forward
  for many people so we once again use gtk-sharp 1.0.x
- Many bugs fixed.
- Many features added.
