D-Bus for .NET
==============

This is a C# implementation of D-Bus. It's often referred to as "managed
D-Bus" to avoid confusion with existing bindings (which wrap libdbus).

See http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp

D-Bus is an inter-process communication framework that lets applications
interface with the system event bus as well as allowing them to talk to
one another in a peer-to-peer configuration.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus for general
information on the D-Bus IPC mechanism.

This software is currently at an early stage of development and not
recommended for use in stable applications.

However it is hoped that it will soon provide a tested, high-performance
bridge to and from all systems that are exposed via D-Bus, regardless of
programming language, UI toolkit or license.

The code was written and is maintained by Alp Toker <alp@atoker.com>

It is a clean-room implementation based on the D-Bus Specification
Version 0.11 and study of the wire protocol of existing tools.

It aims for compatibility with Mono and Microsoft .NET frameworks
supporting the 2.0 profile. Backward compatibility with 1.0 will not be
a consideration.
