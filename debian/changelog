  * New upstream version 0.5.0.3, based on Ubuntu package (Closes: #499615)
  * debian/control: Build-depend on libjpeg62-dev, add gvfs-bin dependency
    so that gphoto patch below works.
  * debian/control: Buid-depend on mono-addins >= 0.4 so that edit sidebar
    works properly and we do not have to use embedded copy of m-a.
  * debian/watch: Update to correct regex.
  * debian/patches/f-spot-import-gphoto.dpatch: Add. Patch by Martin Pitt to
    allow f-spot to import from gphoto:/// URLs.
  * debian/patches/ubuntu_fname_quote_percent.dpatch: Add. Escape '%' in
