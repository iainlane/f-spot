	*** WARNING ***

	This is not ready for end-user consumption yet.

	In particular, the format of the database is still changing
	and the code doesn't handle upgrading existing tables when the
	schema changes.

	If things stop working after a CVS update, chances are that
	the database format has changed.  In that case you will have
	to nuke your database (rm ~/.gnome2/f-spot/photos.db) and
	start over, importing all your pictures again.
