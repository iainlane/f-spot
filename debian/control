Description: personal photo management application
 F-Spot is meant to be an easy-to-use photo management
 application.  It allows for importing of your existing
 photo collections, tagging photos with identifiers,
 as well as doing simple edits of photos (e.g. rotating).
 .
 This application is still in its early stage of development.
